Built with TypeScript and Discord.js, this framework provides an easy way to build Discord applications that leverage Discord's interaction API thanks to its functions and utilities.

As of now, there is no documentation or CLI as the project isn't finalized, but you can still check out the [source code](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/Purplet) and the [sample project](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/Purplet/tree/main/sample) build with it.
