# CRBT OSS

Welcome to the [CRBT](https://crbt.app) GitHub page!

CRBT is a multi-purpose app that expands the Discord experience and provides rich and qualitative features that are made to enpower everyone.

In the CRBT Team, we love free & open-source software, which is why we developed tools like [Purplet](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/Purplet) to enpower everyone to make Discord bots efficiently.

CRBT in itself is [fully open-source](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/CRBT), and so are things around it like [its documentation](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/docs) and [the website](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/Website)!
