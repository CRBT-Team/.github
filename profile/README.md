## Purplet

Built with TypeScript and Vite, Purplet is a Discord bot framework that splits your features into small, hot-reloadable modules, allowing you to move your focus to quickly building your bot ideas.

To get started, use the [`create`](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/Purplet/blob/main/packages/create-purplet) command on your package manager (e.g. `npm init purplet`) to initialize a Purplet project. You can also check the [source code](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/Purplet) and the [example projects](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/Purplet/tree/main/examples) built with it. Purplet is also well [documented](https://purplet.js.org), so make sure to read it.

## CRBTscript

![GitHub package.json version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/crbt-team/CRBTscript?color=F27187&label=version) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CRBT-Team/CRBTscript?color=F27187)

CRBTscript is a placeholder syntax used in the welcome & farewell messages. It allows anyone to embed values that might change thanks to a dynamic interpreter.

The project is [open source](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/CRBTscript) as well, but as its implementation on CRBT's dashboard is not finished, you should read [the documentation](https://crbt.app/script).
